# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

<<<<<<< HEAD
  Finish the project well.
  Get milestones done on time.
=======
We agree to contribute equally to the project and dedicate a significant amount of time to each milestone. Our goal is to complete the milestones on time to the best of our ability. Furthermore, our goal is to successfully  complete the needs and wants of our client to the best of our abilities. We want to start early in case we have trouble!

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
We will communicate with our client through text message and email. We will meet in person with our client at least twice. We will attend the clients workshops and information sessions in order to learn more!


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

Everyone will create their own page, therefore everyone will get exposure to sharpen their current skillset in  HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Also, we will delegate team members to certain key sectors to oversee the project. For example, the coder, the styler, the client connector as well as the design-md writer. The coder will be responsible for the HTML, the styler CSS and the interactions through javascipt. These roles will be delegated by strengths and personal preference but everyone is responsible for helping out on all parts.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We plan to complete each milestone Wednesday night and utilize Thursday for any final changes.We plan to hold each other accountable by setting specific timelines for when parts should be completed. Everyone should be responsible for reviewing others code and providing suggestions for improvement.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

If two people disagree, we will ask the entire group for their opinions for additional ideas/advice. We will create a poll for certain conflicts that arise. We agree to uphold a majority rules approach if conflict arises.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
If we are having a conflict or if someone is not contributing, we will revist this contract and make necessary changes based on our progress throughout the project.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

We will get ice cream when we complete the final project!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
