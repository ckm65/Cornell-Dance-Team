## User Testing Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your tasks for evaluating whether your site will meet the needs of the users. These must be actual user testing tasks. Tasks are not questions!


1. You found a flyer that said Amber Dance Troupe is now taking applications to join. Navigate through the website to apply to be a part of the team.

2. You want to attend a workshop, but you don't know when and where it is. Find the time and location for the workshop you are interested in attending.

# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**

![card sort 1](image/cardsort1.jpeg)
This card sort is broken down into a nav-bar that includes the homepage, about, workshop, instructors, and contact. The homepage will include the clubs values and a gallery. The about page will contain the history, mission and culture. Workshops will contain practice times, location, style, showcase, and ticket information. The instructors page will contain members, year, experience and age. Lastly, the contact page will include an order form, emails, and collaboration. This card sorting will reflect our clients needs and wants.
![card sort 2](image/cardsort2.jpeg)
The card sort is broken down into the homepage, about, workshops, collaboration and contact. The homepage will include values and the gallery. The about page will contain history, mission, culture, instructors, members, age, year, experience. The workshops page will include practice times, location, style, showcase, type of dance, place and ticket information. The collaboration page will include other organizations. Finally the contact page will include the order form and emails.
![card sort 3](image/cardsort3.jpeg)
This card sort is broken down into the homepage, workshops, instructors, showcase, collaboration, gallery and contact. The homepage includes about information such as the history, mission, culture and value. The workshop page includes practice times, location, and dance style. The instructors page includes members, year, experience and age. The showcase page includes time, place and ticket information. The collaborations page has other organizations. The gallery contains pictures and the contact contains order form and the emails of others.

![card sort 4]( image/cardsort4.jpeg)

Our final design came from card sort 4. We found that the homepage and the about page were the same thing so we decided to combine them as the homepage with the nav bar labeled HOME. Our nav bar includes home,E-board, workshops, events, gallery and a apply now page. The homepage includes images of the group as well as the dance groups key values, history and purpose. The E-board contains information on the members in the group. It includes information on their position, year, college and their name. This information is necessary for anyone who is interested in learning more about the club and wanting to contact others. The workshops page will contain a toggle bar that contains the three styles of dances. The user will be able to choose which style of dance they want to explore further and click on that page. There will be a hover interaction feature as well. This allows the user to view and organized website and won't have to scroll to find a style of dance they are specifically looking for. The events tab includes a dropdown menu of performances, showcases and social events. The performances page includes the variety of performances throughout the year. The annual showcase is the clubs really big performance. It will contain information about the event as well as past years with a bunch of pictures. The social events page will include a variety of different events throughout the year to get to know members in the group outside of dance practice. It is an awesome opportunity to connect and interact with others. Finally, the gallery will contain a slideshow of pictures the user can scroll through. These pictures will be from practices, performances or everyday lives of the individuals in the group. Finally, the apply now page will include an application to become apart of e-board. The form will contain a list of the different positions as well as an application form including why you want to be on the e-board, age, name, year and college.

This card sort and design fit best with our target audience and all of the users needs.

The theme for our website is inviting and should be informative towards our user audience. We utilized a blue, grey and black color scheme in order to add a calming affect to our audience. We want our designs to be clean, crips and welcoming because we want to attract new dancers to our group. Dance is very powerful and warming so we tried to incorporate that into the theme and style of our website.



## Interactivity (Milestone 1)
> What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.

Forms: part of the purpose of the website is to recruit, and that includes E-board application. The current club member is also part of the user of the website, and they need to submit information about their costume sizes. Hence, a form can help my client to gather information on running the club in the future.

Photo gallery: as a performing group, our client has many photos on their past performances and practices. Since they want to promote the club, and one way to do that is to present their hard works in the past. Plus, when it comes to performing art, it is easier to show the purpose and dedication through some visual components, like photos. So, a photo gallery will help our client to better achieve another main purpose of their website: to promote the club.

Toggle: the website is also serving current club members. These members are interested in different types of dances, and they need information on their own workshops and practices. Yet, these members, as Cornell students, are busy. They won't want to waste time on trying to browse through all the workshops and practice sessions every time. So, enabling a sorting function for workshops saves time for club members to better find information themselves.

Dropdown: the website will contain a dropdown in the nav bar.This dropdown will be named events and will dropdown into three sub categories: performances, showcases, and social events. These drop downs will contain various information that the user will be able to easily navigate throughout the site.


## User Testing (_optional_)
> This testing is optional.

### User 1 - Testing Notes (Milestone 1)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

### User 1 (Milestone 1)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

User 1 is a female from Cornell. She is a freshman in Arts & Sciences and is not very familiar with the clubs on campus and was very interested in learning more about new things.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes, the user belongs to the target audience


### User 1 - **Desktop** (Milestone 1)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: ALL
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - Overall the user met my expectations. I did think that some users may be confused with the gallery page, but wanted to continue to test it before deciding to make changes to that page.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - An issue that I came across, was that the way the second task was framed was not specific enough, so the user did not know what to look for based on the initial state of the page. The tasks also did not specify any constraints for the form, but I later found that this not including that information tests the validation of the form when the user ran into this issue.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - The users performance went very smoothly and indicated that the usability of the website was acceptable
  - The user was interested in the tasks, so it made the test more engaging and purposeful
- **Re-design choices**
  - Need to reframe the second task
  - Will wait to decide if the gallery should be redesigned
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


### User 2 - Testing Notes (Milestone 1)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 2 (Milestone 1)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?
User 2 is also a female at Cornell. She is a freshman in Arts & Sciences and is involved in athletics on campus and clubs involved in leadership. She was not as interested in learning more about this club as the first user.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes, user 2 is part of the target audience

### User 2 - **Mobile** (Milestone 1)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: ALL
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - User 2 had very similar results to user 1, but this time I reframed the task 2 to give them which workshop to find information for and the results were better.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - This user was a little bit more serious about filling out the form and did not run into any validation errors. This user also was confused by the design on the gallery page and did not use the buttons to go through the slide show. The user was just not interested in looking at the pictures, as inferred by the expression on her face after navigated to the page. The task could be more specific to use the word browse through the pictures on the gallery page, but the interactive task should help the user put themselves in that scenario.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I would still like to wait until completing all the user tests before deciding to change the design of the gallery. For the most part, this user also indicated that the site is usable and easy to navigate.
- **Re-design choices**
  - N/A
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.

...

# Iteration 2

## Client Feedback (Milestone 2)
> You have met once with your client a second time to discuss your initial design. Include your notes from the meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting. Write a few sentences about the design feedback you received from your client.

![email with client 1](image/email1.JPG)

![email with client 2](image/email2.JPG)

![email with client 3](image/email3.JPG)

![meeting notes](image/meeting_note.jpg)

Summary of the second meeting:
The client understands that for the purpose of this project, we cannot target both people interested in the club and club members, so she is okay with us only designing the website for promotion purpose.

The client claims that there won't be any performances left for this semester, and she is okay with us using past performance schedule to complete this assignment.

The client likes the application form: she thinks that this is actually very close to the application they sent out in the past.

The client thinks that we can make navigation of the website more smooth: eboard page and application page can be linked, photo gallary and performance pages can be linked, etc.

The client and I also talked about sending the application form to an email account. We decide to save more detailed discussion to our next meeting.

Because the dropdown menu, workshop toggle, and photo gallery requires javascript that we haven't started, we didn't make them visible for now. But the hidden pages are all here (we just commented them out), and the interactivity pseudocode is up too.

We are also waiting for more information to fill in on workshop and performance pages.

# Iteration 3

## Additional Comments (Milestone 3)
> If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the Project 4 requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.

Because our client no longer has any performance and social events left for this semester, and the date for showcase hasn't been decided yet, we used past performance and social event information for the sake of this project.

- make form validation red
- find a new font for h1
- remove white space from footer

## User Testing
> If you conducted user testing in Milestone 1, you only need to user test 2 more users. Otherwise, you must conduct user testing with 4 users.

### User 3 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 3 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

User 3 is a female from Cornell. She is a junior in CALS and has attended classes at other schools, so she is used to the diversity and differences of other schools. She volunteered herself to participate, so it increases a factor of interest which can be something that can yield better results.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes, user 3 is a part of the target audience

### User 3 - **Desktop** (Final Submission)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: ALL
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - Yes, user 3 met my expectations exactly how I expected all the users to respond. User 3 was able to perform task 2 when the task was reworded and the type of dance was given. This user also understood the purpose of having a slideshow gallery along with a collage of different dances. I received this answer with a follow-up question, so that I could see what was different in this user compared to the other two users. User 3 went in order down the page and was very observant. She mentioned how she went in order of the page which is how she knew to use the buttons unlike the the other two users that just scrolled directly down the page.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - There were no issues in this task and said "This is a really cool website!"
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - Since this user is older than the other two users, this could be a possible hypothesis for why user 3 was able to navigate the gallery page as she showed a difference in thought process.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I would still like to complete one more user test before deciding if the gallery page should be changed or not.
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.

### User 4 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 4 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

User 4 is once again a female at Cornell. She is a senior and a captain of the swim team in the College of Engineering. This user is the oldest of the other 3 users and being in engineering can produce different results in these tasks.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes, user 4 is part of the target audience

### User 4 - **Mobile** (Final Submission)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: ALL
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - User 4 performed very similarly to user 3 and was able to navigate the gallery page. The validations of the form worked and the form was submitted. On the second task, I decided to let the user choose which dance workshop they wanted to attend to make it more interactive and the results were the same as if the dance was just given to them

- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - There were no issues and the tasks ran very smoothly
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - The performance of this user let me conclude that the gallery page will remain the same and the rest of the site is easy to navigate. I have also concluded that there has to be some kind of interest for the users to be engaged in the design and contents of the site.
- **Re-design choices**
  - N/A
- **Additional Notes**
  - The user tests were performed when our website was already polished and pretty much finalized which is why re-design choices were not necessary and the usability of the site was smooth. The results were also pretty redundant and there were only 2 tasks that there were any issues which is why I didn't feel it necessary to fill out a task evaluation for each individual task.

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?


## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)
> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.


> 2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.


> 3. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.


> 4. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.
