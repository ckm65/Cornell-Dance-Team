# Planning

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?

Our client is Amber Dance Troupe, founded in 2003. This is performing group that focuses on promoting Chinese tradition folk dance, contemporary dance, and jazz. The hold workshops every week, perform across campus, and hold annual showcase.

They want an informative website, and they also want to include recruitment information. They want a website that is welcoming for target audience, and they want to promote the club as well as its cultural influence. Further details are included in the purpose section.

## Site's Purpose (Milestone 1)
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.

We are making a website for Amber Dance Troupe (focusing on Chinese tradition/folk dance, contemporary dance, and jazz), and this cite will be an informative presentation of the club; it should also contain information/form for E-Members, G-Members to look over and interact with.

Our client's target audience is female Cornellians who are committed to dancing. But our clients expect all these types of people to visit the site:
  1. dancers who are interested in Amber specifically
  2. people who have heard about the club but are looking for more information about the club
  3. club member to look up for workshop information, application/order forms, etc.
  4. Cornell administration to ensure that the club is actually holding events
  5. Other performing art clubs that are looking for collaboration

Here are some pages/information that our client expects to see:
  - information about club history
  - information about current workshops
  - E-board introduction and recruitment info
  - instructors introduction
  - annual showcase information
  - event page: performance schedule + social events

  - Create a page for order page, and the page will be a form.
- **Memo**
  - N/A


## User(s) (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the users (target audience) for this website.

Our overall target audience is females at Cornell University. However, our target audience is broken down into three different sectors.  The first sector is targeted at females that are already in the dance group. This allows the entire group to collaborate with each other and keep up to date on current events and competitions. The second sector is for any females at Cornell University that are interested in joining a dance group or becoming more involved in the dance world (no experience necessary). Finally, the third sector is targeted at other clubs on campus that would like to partner or promote or dance troupe. It can be targeted at other organizations that would like to get involved.

## User Testing Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your tasks for evaluating whether your site will meet the needs of the users. These must be actual user testing tasks. Tasks are not questions!


1. You found a flyer that said Amber Dance Troupe is now taking applications to join. Navigate through the website to apply to be a part of the team.

2. You want to attend a workshop, but you don't know when and where it is. Find the time and location for the next workshop.

3. You are part of a band and you want to collaborate with Amber Dance Troupe. Navigate the website to find out who to contact.

4. It's the spring and you want to find more things to do. You are interested in attending the annual showcase. Navigate to get more information on the event.



## Content (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your site's content (text, images, etc.). Make a list of **all** the content you will need. This list should be **exhaustive**.

- Homepage (i.e history, mission, values, culture)
- Current Workshops(i.e practice times, locations, types of workshops)
- eBoard and Instructors(photos and description of positions)
- For Members (application and forms)
- Annual Showcase
- Gallery
- Contact (i.e collaboration)

## Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 1)
> Come up with some idea for interactive features for your site.

- Forms
- Gallery
- Sorting

# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**

![card sort 1](image/cardsort1.jpeg)

![card sort 2](image/cardsort2.jpeg)

![card sort 3](image/cardsort3.jpeg)

## Interactivity (Milestone 1)
> What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.

Forms: part of the purpose of the website is to recruit, and that includes E-board application. The current club member is also part of the user of the website, and they need to submit information about their costume sizes. Hence, a form can help my client to gather information on running the club in the future.

Photo gallary: as a performing group, our client has many photos on their past performances and practices. Since they want to promote the club, and one way to do that is to present their hard works in the past. Plus, when it comes to performing art, it is easier to show the purpose and dedication through some visual components, like photos. So, a photo gallary will help our client to better achieve another main purpose of their website: to promote the club.

Sorting: the website is also serving currect club members. These members are interested in different types of dances, and they need information on their own workshops and practices. Yet, these members, as Cornell students, are busy. They won't want to waste time on trying to browse through all the workshops and practice sessions every time. So, enabling a sorting function for workshops saves time for club members to better find inforamtion for themselves.
